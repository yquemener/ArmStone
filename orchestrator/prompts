I want a pyqt widget that shows a live video captured through opencv on /dev/video2

The widget is resizable and the video is accordingly rescaled in it but preserving the aspect ratio.

On the right of the video is a small checkable button that says "zoom". When enabled, the size of the video display does not change but the view is not scaled anymore but cropped.

The cropped offset is changed by doing dragging operations inside the image.

Call this widget VideoView and write a program to demonstrate it.
